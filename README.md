Why?
- Took a year off work and wanted to see how long I could stretch my holidays with no income but I didn't know how much I spent
  per week. Tried tracking everything on paper, or using a spreadsheet, but it was always too complicated to stay on track.
- Now I can just open the app on the go, press Add Entry, fill in 2 inputs real quick, and forget.
- I can share a budget with my partner and track our Food spending together.

Goal
- Easy login process, email + password or apple signin.
- Wanted to make it as simple as possible with no unecessary feature. No connecting to banks or what.
- Manual inputs only.
- Use case: I'm at the store, while waiting for receipt to print or while walking back to the car,
i can easily input amount and category. Done.
- Recurring payments are also easily handled. Created them once let the magic happen.
- I want to add income tracking as well to extrapolate net worth over time based on current spending and income.

What's the deal?
- Ridiculously simple to use
- One feature: Track your spending
- No financial wizardry required

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
